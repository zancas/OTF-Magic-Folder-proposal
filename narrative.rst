* ethical imperative: Human rights defenders have a "First do no harm" ethical imperative to protect the information of the people they work with.

* normalization: Human rights defenders, journalists, activists, and vulnerable populations use whatever tools have been featured in the media, e.g. Dropbox, rather than using specialized tools that are designed for their use case. Therefore to achieve the best outcomes the safe tool needs to be targeted at a wide user base, and be easy to discover and to use.

* sustainability: the Tahoe-LAFS project is a thriving open source community of independent hackers and organizations from around the world. Magic Folders will be exciting and welcome, and will attract support from many contributors. In addition, LeastAuthority intends to sell Magic Folder commercial services, and to continue to invest in improving it and producing complementary products and services.
