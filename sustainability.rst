There are two complementary ways that Magic Folders will be sustained after
this project.

First, Tahoe-LAFS is a thriving Free and Open Source project which has
garnered praise, support, and contributions from many sources (see the
“Community Interaction” section). We expect that the successful completion of
the Magic Folders project will stimulate even greater enthusiasm from such
contributors.

Second, LeastAuthority intends to commercialize Magic Folders for profit. If
that attempt succeeds, LeastAuthority will likely reinvest some of the profit
in improving and extending Magic Folders and in creating complementary
products.

In pursuit of that ambition, LeastAuthority has designed this Magic Folders
proposal as a “Minimum Viable Product” — intended to reach usability as soon
as possible in order to start the process of iteratively learning from the
response of users and improving the product.

The Free and Open Source software licence of Tahoe-LAFS allows proprietary
extensions of Tahoe-LAFS, but requires that all such extensions be
contributed back to the pool of Free and Open Source software within 12
months of distribution. This allows for-profit companies (not only
LeastAuthority, but any company) to sell proprietary extensions for a limited
time, while ensuring that all such extensions become part of the common open
codebase in the long-term.

LeastAuthority's plan is to contribute the results of the OTF-funded Magic
Folders project immediately into the Free and Open Source codebase, and to
widely publicize it as a possible solution for those people who have been
asking for a secure and Open Source alternative to Dropbox. Simultaneously,
LeastAuthority intends to start selling hosted Magic Folders service.
