Magic Folders will be an alternative to Dropbox that people in repressive
countries can use to collaborate and to share their work. Unlike Dropbox,
Magic Folders will protect the user’s files with end-to-end cryptography, so
that adversaries who compromise a server cannot spy on or alter the files.
Also unlike Dropbox, the entire stack of client and server software will be
Free and Open Source, so that people who are blocked from accessing foreign
services can deploy Magic Folders using only their own local resources.
