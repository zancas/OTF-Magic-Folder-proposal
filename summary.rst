Magic Folders will be an alternative to Dropbox that people in repressive
countries can use to collaborate and to share their work. Unlike Dropbox,
Magic Folders will protect the user’s files with end-to-end cryptography, so
that adversaries who compromise a server cannot spy on the files or inject
content into them.  Also unlike Dropbox, the entire stack of client and
server software will be Free and Open Source, so that people who are blocked
from accessing foreign services can deploy Magic Folders using only their own
local resources.
